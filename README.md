# AWS RDS MySQL Lab: Setting Up and Connecting a Database

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to set up an AWS RDS MySQL instance and connect it to a web application. The process involves configuring security groups, networking, and database connectivity to ensure high availability and secure access.

## Objectives
By completing this lab, I:
1. Launched an Amazon RDS MySQL instance with high availability.
2. Configured security groups to allow connections from a web server.
3. Connected a web application to the database and verified data persistence.

## Key Tasks Completed:
1. Created a Security Group to allow database access from a web server.
